# Palindrome Checking

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the TODO markers inside of this file and
either remove or rewrite the prompts. When you are finished with this reflection
it should contain professional writing that is suitable for publishing. That
includes removing this paragraph!

## Add Your Name Here

## 1. Program Use and Output

TODO: Use at least four fenced code blocks to provide usage and output from
four different runs of `palindromechecker` with different inputs. Don't
forget to include what you actually typed into the command-line.

- Recursive: Input a `word` that is a palindrome
- Recursive: Input a `word` that is not a palindrome
- Reverse: Input a `word` that is a palindrome
- Reverse: Input a `word` that is not a palindrome

## 2. Testing Output

TODO: What is the output from running the test suite with test coverage
monitoring? How good are your tests? Answer the previous questions as well
as the questions below.

- Provide the command that you used to run the coverage tracking for the test suite
- Explain the quality of your tests as given by the coverage report
- While you are not required to achieve `100%` coverage of the program under
  test, you are encouraged to achieve as high of test coverage as you can, and
  explain why you can or cannot reach `100%`.

## 3. Source Code

TODO: Describe in detail how the completed source code works. Place the
code in a fenced code block, then describe what it does.

- An example of a test case for the command-line interface of the
  `palindromechecker`
- An example of a test case for the `util` module of the `palindromechecker`
- An example of a test case for the `palindrome` module of the
  `palindromechecker`
- An import statement accessing the palindrome module
- An import statement accessing the cli object from main.py

## 4. Professional Development

TODO: Answer the following questions in your own words.

- What was the greatest challenge that you faced when completing this assignment?
- Leveraging your response to the previous question, how did you overcome the challenge?
- Think of an appropriate activity that you associate with play. Make a list of
  the characteristics of that activity that make it seem playful. Are software testing and debugging also playful activities with the same characteristics? Why or why not?
