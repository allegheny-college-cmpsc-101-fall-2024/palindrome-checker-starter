## Introduction

This engineering labs invites you to implement a program called
`palindromechecker` that can determine whether an input word is or is not
a palindrome, i.e., a word that is spelled the same both forwards and
backwards. Two approaches will be implemented.

This lab is an Engineering Lab. As described in the syllabus:

**Engineering Labs** are graded, i.e. assigned a number or percentage
indicative of the proportion of points earned relative to the total possible.

- Fifty percent of the grade of each Engineering Lab is determined by
  the percentage of gatorgrade checks passed.
- One quarter of the grade is determined by code correctness following a rubric.
- One quarter of the grade is determined by professional skills and presentation
  following a rubric. Professional presentation is impacted by linting,
  formatting, testing, profiling, duplication avoidance, commenting, markdown
  styling and communication in reflections.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives of this assignment are to:

1. Use Git and GitHub to manage source code file changes
2. Implement recursive and non-recursive palindrome functions
3. Implement test functions for pytest and check test coverage
4. Import modules from packages
5. Demonstrate professional skills in linting and formatting
6. Write clearly about the programming concepts in this assignment.

## Project Details ([Project Overview](#project-overview) Below)

This engineering labs invites you to implement a program called
`palindromechecker` that can determine whether an input word is or is not
a palindrome, or a word that is spelled the same both forwards and backwards.
For instance, the word `civic` is a palindrome because it is spelled the same
both forwards and backwards while `example` is not. Specifically, you will
implement one approach to palindrome checking that uses recursion and another
that reverses the word. In addition to implementing these two approaches for
palindrome checking, you will create a comprehensive command-line interface
using [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/). Along with implementing your own
test cases for the functions that determine whether the word is a palindrome,
you will also add documentation to your `palindromechecker` in the form of
docstrings for both the functions and the module.

### Expected Output

This project invites you to implement a Python program, called
`palindromechecker`, that features different ways determine whether or not a
number is a palindrome. After you finish a correct implementation of all the
program's features, running it with the command `poetry run palindromechecker
--word civic --approach recursive`, it will produce this output. See a later
section for more output examples!

```text
âœ¨ Awesome, using the recursive approach for palindrome checking!

ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "civic" is a palindrome!

ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? Yes, it is!
```

Don't forget that you can display `palindromechecker`'s help menu and learn more
about its features by typing `poetry run palindromechecker --help` to show the
following output. This help menu shows that `palindromechecker` has a
`--approach` flag that enables it to check whether or not a word is a palindrome
through the use of a `reverse`-based or `recursive`-based technique.

```

Please note that the provided source code does not contain all of the
functionality needed to produce the output displayed in this section and later
in the project description. As the next section explains, you should add the
features needed to ensure that `palindromechecker` produces the expected output!
Importantly, this project invites you to add both a recursion-based and
reversal-based algorithm for palindrome checking.

#### Reminder

>Don't forget that if you want to run the `palindromechecker` program you must use
>your terminal window to first go into the GitHub repository containing this
>project and then go into the `palindromechecker` directory that contains the
>project's source code. Finally, remember that before running the program you
>must run `poetry install` to add its dependencies, such as Pytest, and Rich.

### Adding Functionality

If you study the file `palindromechecker/palindromechecker/main.py` you will see
that it has many `TODO` markers that designate the parts of the program that you
need to implement before `palindromechecker` will produce correct output. Once
you complete a task associated with a `TODO` marker, make sure that you delete
it and revise the prompt associated with the marker into a meaningful comment.
To ensure that the program works correctly, you must implement all of these
functions in the `palindrome` module:

- `def to_chars(word: str) -> str`
- `def is_palindrome(word: str) -> bool`
- `def is_palindrome_recursive(word: str) -> bool`
- `is_palindrome_reverse(word: str) -> bool`

After finishing your implementation of `palindromechecker` you should repeatedly
run the program in different configurations to confirm that it produces the
correct output. Since the `palindromechecker` provides a checking mode based on
reversing the string or recursively checking the string, you should make sure
that both approaches work correctly. You should also confirm that the
`palindromechecker` can correctly determine when a word both is and is not a
palindrome. Here are some examples that show the program's correct execution for
different values for the `--word` and `--approach` arguments. If you correctly
resolve all of the `TODO` markers in the provided source code your program
should produce the same output for each of these commands.

- `poetry run palindromechecker --word civic --approach recursive`

```cmd
âœ¨ Awesome, using the recursive approach for palindrome checking!

ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "civic" is a palindrome!

ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? Yes, it is!
```

- `poetry run palindromechecker --word civic --approach reverse`

```cmd
âœ¨ Awesome, using the reverse approach for palindrome checking!

ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "civic" is a palindrome!

ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? Yes, it is!
```

- `poetry run palindromechecker --word origin --approach recursive`

```cmd
âœ¨ Awesome, using the recursive approach for palindrome checking!

ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "origin" is a palindrome!

ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? No, it is not!
```

- `poetry run palindromechecker --word origin --approach reverse`

```cmd
âœ¨ Awesome, using the reverse approach for palindrome checking!

ðŸ”– Going to check to see if the word "origin" is a palindrome!

ðŸ˜† Is this word a palindrome? No, it is not!
```

### Running Checks

### Helper Tasks

Helper tasks are run in the terminal with the poetry environment activated.
The format of the commands are always `poetry run task xyz`...where `xyz`
is the helper task name.

If you study the source code in the `pyproject.toml` file you will see that it
includes the following section that specifies different executable "helper
task" names like `ruff`, `fix`, `ruffdetails`, etc.

```toml
[tool.taskipy.tasks]
```

If you are in the `palindromechecker` directory that contains the
`pyproject.toml` file, the helper tasks
make it easy to run commands like `poetry run task ruff` to automatically run
the ruff linter designed to check the Python source code in your program
to confirm that your source code adheres to industry standards for formatting.
You can also use the command `poetry run task fix` to automatically reformat the
source code. `poetry run task ruffdetails` will print out detailed linting errors
that point to exactly what ruff views as a linting error. Make sure to examine
the `pyproject.toml` file for other convenient tasks that you can use to both
check and improve your project!

### Gatorgrade

The command `gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml` will check your work. If
your work meets the baseline requirements and adheres to the best practices that
proactive programmers adopt you will see that all the checks pass when you run
`gatorgrade`. Try to pass as many checks as you can. Missing some checks will only
impact a part of your grade in this Engineering Lab. Note, modifications to the
gatorgrade.yml file are not permitted without explicit instruction.

### Pytest

If your program has
all of the anticipated functionality, you can run the command `poetry run task
test` and see that the test suite produces output like the following. Can you
add comments to explain how these tests work? What are the key components of
every test case created with Pytest? How do the tests "cover" the source code
the of the program?

```text
tests/test_main.py ....
tests/test_palindrome.py ....
tests/test_util.py ..
```

### Coverage Report

For this assignment, you
can also use the command `poetry run task coverage` to create a coverage report,
like the one shown below, that reveals how well your tests exercise the source
code in the program `palindromechecker` program. You should try to write test
cases that completely cover the program's source code, producing a report like
this one.

```text
Name                              Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
---------------------------------------------------------------
palindromechecker/__init__.py         1      0   100%
palindromechecker/main.py            26      0   100%
palindromechecker/palindrome.py      18      0   100%
palindromechecker/util.py             4      0   100%
---------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                49      0   100%
```

### Project Reflection

Once you have finished both of the previous technical tasks, you can use a text
editor to answer all of the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` file. For
instance, you should provide the output of the Python program in a fenced code
block, explain the meaning of the Python source code segments that you
implemented, and answer all of the other questions about your experiences in
completing this project. A specific goal of the reflection for this project is
to continue to explore how test cases and test coverage information can help a
developer to both establish a confidence in the correctness of and to find bugs
in a Python program. Once you have finished addressing the prompts in the
`writing/reflection.md` file that have `TODO` makers given as reminders, make
sure that you delete the prompt.

## Project Assessment

Since this project is an engineering effort, it is aligned with the
**evaluating** and **creating** levels of [Bloom's
taxonomy](/proactive-learning/blooms-taxonomy/). You can learn more about how a
proactive programming expert will assess your work by examining the [assessment
strategy](/proactive-learning/assessment-strategy/). From the start to the end
of this project you may make an unlimited number of reattempts at submitting
source code and technical writing that meet all aspects of the project's
specification.
